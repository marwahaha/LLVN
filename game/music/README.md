This folder is quite tricky, since it contains copyrighted content.
Since I don't know anything about legal stuff I can't say for 100% that this is fair use.

If you can think of reasons why this is fair use, fork this and create a pull request with this file updated.

If it isn't: Create an issue with the reasons why not. 
If I think your reasons are correct, I'll change the music, tho it would be quite sad if I needed to.
